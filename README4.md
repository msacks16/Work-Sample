The CMiC algorithm essentially compresses colored images to a far smaller greyscale form using a mixture of Quantization, Differential Encoding and Huffman encoding. Instructions are as follows:
1. Note that the first command line argument is the input image and the second is the output file.
2. The Decoder uses similar arguments; the first is the input file name and the second is the output file.

COMPRESSION RATIOS:
Car.tiff (given image) = 
Baldy.tiff (Nature) = 
Jetta.tiff (another car, not too many big variations) = 
# Public
# Work-Sample
# Work-Sample
